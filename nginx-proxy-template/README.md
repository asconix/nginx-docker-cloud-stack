# Ghost Nginx Proxy Template

This Nginx configuration template is an EY-specific template meant to be used
in conjunction with [jwilder/docker-gen](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen)
in the context of [JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion).

This template and it's usage was inspired by this post from Louis King ([jinglemansweep](https://github.com/jinglemansweep)):
https://louisking.xyz/blog/2016/02/21/docker-cloud-nginx.html and Donovan Muller ([donovanmuller](https://github.com/donovanmuller)).
